    "I believe that the relationship closely resembles the exponential function, $e^{(x-1930)/27}$. As the graph approaches the x-axis, it starts to flatten out. The function also seems to exponentially grow. In order to get a function that would fit our data, the exponential would have to be translated by 1930 to the right. Through trial and error, dividing the exponent by 27 seems to even the out to closely match our data."
